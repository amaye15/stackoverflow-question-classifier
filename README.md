## Important

All credit goes to huggingface user [MoritzLaurer](https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer) as his model is the basis for this project.

## Introduction
The Automatic Stack Overflow Question Classifier harnesses the latest advancements in artificial intelligence to systematically categorize questions on Stack Overflow. Its primary goal is to streamline the process of sorting queries, enhancing navigability, and improving the overall user experience on the platform.

## About the Project
This initiative takes advantage of the DeBERTa V3 model's capabilities in zero-shot classification. By doing so, it aims to revolutionize how questions are organized on Stack Overflow. Instead of relying on manual categorization, which can be time-consuming and inconsistent, this project introduces an automated, AI-driven approach for more precise and efficient question sorting.
