# Automatic Stack Overflow Question Classifier

## Introduction
The Automatic Stack Overflow Question Classifier harnesses the latest advancements in artificial intelligence to systematically categorize questions on Stack Overflow. Its primary goal is to streamline the process of sorting queries, enhancing navigability, and improving the overall user experience on the platform.

## About the Project
This initiative takes advantage of the DeBERTa V3 model's capabilities in zero-shot classification. By doing so, it aims to revolutionize how questions are organized on Stack Overflow. Instead of relying on manual categorization, which can be time-consuming and inconsistent, this project introduces an automated, AI-driven approach for more precise and efficient question sorting.

## Key Features
- **Zero-shot classification**: This feature allows the model to categorize questions into specific topics without needing prior examples in those categories, showcasing the model's ability to understand and interpret natural language with remarkable accuracy.
- **Streamlit Web App**: The project includes a user-friendly Streamlit-based web application that enables real-time classification of questions, demonstrating the model's capabilities interactively.

## Technology Stack
- **Model**: DeBERTa V3, renowned for its effectiveness in natural language processing and understanding, forms the core of our classification system.
- **Framework**: The project utilizes Streamlit, a modern framework for building interactive and intuitive web applications tailored for machine learning and data science projects.

## Implementation Details
The DeBERTa V3 model is at the forefront of this project, chosen for its state-of-the-art performance in natural language understanding tasks. Our implementation fine-tunes this model for the specific context of Stack Overflow questions, ensuring high accuracy and reliability in classification results.
